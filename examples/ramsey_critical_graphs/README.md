# Ramsey critical graphs
Ramsey critical graphs are graphs that are maximally non-Ramsey, meaning they have a coloring that avoid red subgraph G1 and blue subgraph G2 for a given pair of graphs. They pose a lower bound on the Ramsey number R(G1, G2) and are used to study Ramsey theory in combinatorics.

## requirements
this example requires the NetworkX library to be installed. You can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install networkx
```
